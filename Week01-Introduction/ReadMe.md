explaination for 912-A

First of all all we have to do is to declare all the variables. Then, we input the first two integers that contains yellow and blue crystals on Grisha's Disposal
then we input the second three integers that contains about how many we want Grisha makes the balls.

Then we use while loops
while (yellball>0)
    {
       yellcrys = yellcrys+2;
       yellball--;
    }
it's for the requirements that 1 yellow ball contains 2 yellow crystals, so when yellball>0, the loops will run again, until yellball<0 so the loops will end, that's what yellball-- for.
After that we will get the amount of yellow crystals that Grisha has to keep so she can creates the yellow ball(s).

after that 
 total = yelldis + bluedis;
    prod = yellcrys + bluecrys;
    acquire = prod - total;

the total is what Grisha has in her disposal, and prod is amount of crystals that Grisha has to collect.
when the numbers counted, the amount of prod will be reduced by total, so it shows up the numbers of crystal acquirements that Grisha have to collect later.


explanation for 854-A

First of all all we have to do is to declare all the variables. 
then i use while loops 
while(ave<3 || ave>10000)

because there are some acquirements that the numbers have to 3<n<1000
